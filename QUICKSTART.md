# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Get your cyberpunk portfolio running in 3 steps:

## 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
cd portfolio-site
npm install
```

## 2️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at **http://localhost:3000** with Turbopack hot-reloading enabled.

## 3️⃣ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a static export in the `out/` directory, ready to deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.
